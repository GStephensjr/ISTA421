##### 4. (Not in book) In the cotext of software design patterns, the term singleton has a specific meaning. What is the singleton pattern used for?
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

A singleton is a class that only allows a single instance of itself to be created, and usually gives simple access to that instance.

Most commonly, singletons don't allow any parameters to be specified when creating the instance, since a second request of an instance with a different parameter could be problematic! (If the same instance should be accessed for all requests with the same parameter then the factory pattern is more appropriate.)
